3-Intialize the user active feild to false
4-Send email to the emailid of the user
5-When the user clicks the link,  user active feild is set to true

1- Secret token is generated through randomstring package which is a library to create random strings. 
2- Syntax is randomstring.generate(n) with n representing the length of the string 
UserSchema contains fields - activation_key(String), active(Boolean)
3- When the Post request for user registration is handled, activation_key is mapped to secret token and the active value to false
4- Then a email is triggered to the user,  with the content
Hi there, 
Thank you for registering! 
Please verify your email on the page: http://139.59.83.115:3000/users/activation?email=bhavesh.badjatya@gmail.com&token=teHAMOJ3 by the following token:
Token: teHAMOJ3
Have a pleasant day.
5 - Email is triggered using the package @sendgrid/mail
6- http://139.59.83.115:3000/users/activation - This link redirects the user to the activation page, where activation code has to be submitted
7-  If the activation_key matches with the user with the given email id then the active status is turned to True. This completes the email activation process.
